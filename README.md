<h1>To Do List Project</h1>
<p>The To Do List Project exists as a place for me to practice implementation of my up and coming JavaScript skills, as well as increase my fluency in Git.</p>
<p>The project has multiple iterations which gradually increase in usability and excellence.</p>
<p> This project also utilizes github's project management system.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
